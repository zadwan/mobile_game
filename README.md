In this study, I used a mobile puzzle game dataset from Kaggle(Mobile Games: A/B Testing). This dataset is based on a mobile game called Cookie Cats. Using A/B testing on the dataset, I found that altering the player's progress by adding time gates (waiting periods) at different levels has a direct effect on the player's retention. In this case, introducing the gate in level 30 resulted in higher player retention compared to when the gate is introduced at level 40. This findings identify the opportunities for the game producers to retain players and build a larger player base.
